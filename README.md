# PrepaidPhonePlanBalanceChecker
Simple command line tool to check your prepaid phone plan balance.

This tool can for example be run in a cron job to regularly check your balance and send out an e-mail notification if the balance falls below a given limit.

Note: this tool has exclusively been implemented and tested for https://www.aldi-mobile.ch/ and will require adoption for other providers, but may act as an inspiration :)
